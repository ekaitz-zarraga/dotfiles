# Configuration files
My dotfiles. Vim, NeoVim, Git, Tmux and Bash for now.

Use `install.sh` to install the dotfiles. It uses `stow` internally.

```shell
... $ git clone [THIS REPO]
.../dotfiles $ cd dotfiles
.../dotfiles $ sh install.sh
```

> Stow makes links to the files in the target directory.
